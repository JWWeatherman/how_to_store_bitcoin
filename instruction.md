# Provide Entropy for Private Keys

To ensure that your private keys are truely random
grab a handful of pennies after shaking them in a box
and place them on the table one at a time.

For each "heads" type a 1 and for each "tails" type a 0.
Each private key is 256 bits so you will need to do this 256 times.
