# Overview
This guide is intended to provide
ideas and suggestions in how to 
secure your bitcoin investment.

Bitcoin is an new technology
that is not finished yet.
If you are trying to invest in
bitcoin in 2018 you should understand
that you are becoming a beta tester
for a new form of money and that
this involves both work and risk.

It would be wise to test this guide
at least once using a smaller
dollar amount to make sure it works
and that you are comfortable.

It is intended for securing amounts
between $2,000 and $50,000.
For amounts under $2,000 a hardware wallet
and the instructions included
are sufficient.

I love you enough to write this
and make it free,
but I don't love you enough
to give you your money back
if there is an error or you 
make a mistake 
so use at your own risk
and be careful.

# Step 1 - Generate a 24 word seed
The first step in securing your bitcoin
is to generate a bitcoin seed.
The bitcoin seed is essentially
a very long password
(24 words)
that gives you,
or anyone else that has it,
control over your bitcoin.

Generating this password is tricky
because you need it to be
as unexpected as possible
and this is difficult.

The best way to do it right now
is to use a hardware wallet
such as a Trezor or Ledger
or Cold Card.
This is because these single purpose 
computers or more trustworthy 
than your laptop or desktop
because they are less likely to have
a virus or other malicious code.

Unfortunately many of these "hardware wallets"
require the use of a laptop or desktop
to function and will display the seed words
on the laptop or desktop.
If you have a hardware wallet that can 
generate and display a 24 word seed
without being connected to another computer this step 
is easy - do that and then write down all 24 words on paper.

If your hardware wallet requires a computer
you should create a backup and then 
format and reinstall your operating system.
Then be sure to never connect it to any network
(including your wifi network at home),
generate and write down your 24 word seed,
and then format and reinstall your OS again
to make sure that the seed 
is no longer stored on your laptop.

This might seem like excessive work,
but it is doable for most people 
within a couple hours and buys you 
some reasonable security as well as some 
extra margin of error in making mistakes
at some of the other steps.

Make another copy of your 24 word seed
by copying the paper you first used - 
do not make this copy from the hardware
wallet.

Hide your first copy in a safe place.
We will be working with that second copy
for the rest of the process.

# Step 2 - send your bitcoin "to your seed words"
Now that you have a 24 word seed that
has been generated securely and has never been 
on any computer connected to the internet
you are ready to move your bitcoin to that seed.

To do that use your hardware wallet to generate a public key
and send over $50 worth of bitcoin.

After the bitcoin balance shows $50 on your hardware wallet
erase the hardware wallet.
If you did not write down your seed correctly 
you just lost $50 forever. 
No one can ever recover it for you.

Now, using your 24 word seed,
recover your bitcoin wallet 
and ensure you still have $50.

At this point you can move over all of your funds
to the 24 word seed by generating new
addresses on the hardware wallet and transferring
your bitcoin to those addresses.

Use random amount between $3,000 and $5,000.
This will improve your privacy a little
and only cost you a tiny amount in bitcoin fees
and hassle.

Once this is complete and you are satisfied
that all of your bitcoin has been
sent to your 24 word seed
you can erase your hardware wallet.

Now you have bitcoin that can only be
accessed using your 24 word seed
stored on paper.

# Step 3 - Split your seed into 3 parts
Your 24 word seed is essentially
a really long password.
It needs to be very long because
unlike your email password
hackers can guess the correct answer
millions of times per second.

To make it less likely that you will lose
your seed we are going to split 
it into 3 parts that will allow you
to recover your bitcoin as long as you
have at least 2 of the parts.

We will also make it so that it
would require a lot of expense
and expertise to recreate your seed,
if it is even possible,
with only a single part.

To do this copy your 24 words
to three different sheets of paper
to match this diagram.

### Warning: 
If you are not certain that you
can recover all 24 words in the
event that one of the sheets is lost
you should not proceed further.


# Step 4 - Storing your 24 words
Burn any papers that contain your seed word
except the 3 that have parts of your seed
that allow you to recreate the entire 24 
words as long as you have 2 of the 3 sheets.

This step should be terrifying.

Store one of the sheets in your home safe,
one of the sheets in a safety deposit box
at least 5 miles from your home,
and the third sheet with a trusted family member.

Keep in mind that if someone gets one of your
sheets they could work with a hacker to guess
your missing words and if they get two of them
they will be able to steal all of your bitcoin 
so be sure to keep them in safe places.

Good work. 
This has been a terrifying process,
but slowly you will realize the security
and satisfaction of knowing
no one can easily steal your bitcoin.
